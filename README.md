## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Flexbox
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### What I learned

For this project, I decided to challenge myself further by working without a Figma layout.
Despite that, I managed to match the design and extract variables into a separate SCSS file, relying on experience from previous projects. Using a preprocessor was also recommended, though this wasn’t my first time applying one.

What tools do you use to make life easier when a Figma layout isn’t available, or when it lacks a consistent design system?

### Continued development

I underestimated how difficult it is to maintain pixel-perfect design alignment without a Figma mockup — by the end, I honestly felt a bit burnt out, and it’s clear that fatigue affected my code quality. I’ll definitely need to revisit and refactor this project later.

### Useful resources

- [Sass installation](https://sass-lang.com/install/) - Here you can find instructions on installing the preprocessor and setting up a project for development.
